# Evaluations

Prior info:
- For the purpose of surveying the game and interactivity, a flight cheat was included, and players were asked to use it at their own discretion when they felt stuck 
	â€“ button is y on the left controller, followed by using the joystick and head to 	  fly around
	- flight can be enabled and disabled at anytime, should the player wish to skip  	  certain parts and not others
- Game is fully completable without flight cheat
- The hand physics system made control over the launcher and satchels much more      
  difficult, as your hands would displace increasingly more with your velocity

### Response #1:

- On a scale of 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now?
	- 6
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how present did you feel in the virtual world?
	- 2
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task?
	- 3

Notes (summarized):
- launcher and satchel too hard to control
- no checkpoints is very frustrating
- satchel should be in a more grabbable place, maybe even adjustable
- satchel could use a reduced cooldown
- kept falling on the first few platforms and then flew to the top

### Response #2:
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how much motion sickness do you perceive right now?
	- 5
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how present did you feel in the virtual world?
	- 4
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how much fun did you have during the task?
	- 7

Notes (summarized):
- difficult and needs lots of practice
- slopes make it hard to rocket jump off of
