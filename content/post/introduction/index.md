# The Idea 

When coming up with an idea for what game to make, I decided to look at some games I enjoyed playing which have concepts that I haven't seen done in VR. I usually play shooting games, including Valorant and Team Fortress 2:

I also took inspiration from games I watch people play, and something I've always enjoyed is seeing streamers get angry at difficult games. Some examples of games like these include Getting Over It and Jump King, both notorious for infuriating people since a single mistake can reset hours of progress:

The final thing I took inspiration from was a VR game called Windlands which I played a long time ago and loved:

I really enjoyed Windlands because it did a great job of giving players a sense of speed while keeping motion sickness down to a minimum and the movement felt smooth and fun.

So, combining all of these things, I wanted a game that featured this explosive jumping functionality, involved climbing, and had fast movement. 

Something I would like to point out, is that reducing motion sickness wasn't one of my main priorities here. Not only have I not experienced motion sickness in VR (apart from when I've encountered bugs with the player camera), but I also thought it wouldn't be to massive an issue with such simple textures and, even if it was, I could just consider it part of the challenge.
